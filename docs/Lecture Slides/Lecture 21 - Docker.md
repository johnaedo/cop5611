## Core Concepts

Containers are lightweight, standalone software packages that include everything needed to run an application:
- Application code
- Runtime environment
- System tools
- System libraries
- Configuration files

---

Unlike traditional virtualization, containers share the host operating system's kernel while running in isolated user spaces.

---
## Core Operating System Requirements
---
**Supported Operating Systems**
- 64-bit Linux distributions
- Officially supported distributions include:
  - Debian
  - Ubuntu
  - CentOS
  - Fedora
---
**Essential Kernel Features**
- Linux namespaces for process isolation
- Control groups (cgroups) for resource management
- 64-bit architecture support
---
## Minimum System Requirements
---
**Hardware Specifications**
- 2 CPU cores
- 8GB RAM
- 60GB hard drive space
- Network interface card
---
**Basic Infrastructure**
- Configured IP addressing
- DNS resolution
- Updated system patches
- Proper security hardening
---
## Additional Considerations
---
**Host OS Selection Factors**
- Purpose of deployment (development vs. production)
- Whether the system needs to do more than just host Docker
- Deployment environment (bare metal, virtual machines, or cloud)
- Support requirements and lifecycle management
---
**Performance Optimizations**
- Docker daemon requires minimal overhead
- Container resource usage is similar to running applications directly on the host
- Memory can be constrained per container
- Storage driver selection affects performance
---
For optimal Docker performance and stability, it's recommended to use a current version of a supported Linux distribution with an up-to-date kernel that includes all the necessary container features.

## Key Characteristics
- Resource Efficiency
- Isolation and Security
- Portability
---
**Resource Efficiency**
- Requires fewer resources than virtual machines
- Shares the OS kernel between containers
- Takes up minimal storage space (typically tens of MBs)
- Starts up faster than traditional VMs
---
**Isolation and Security**
- Each container operates independently
- Has its own runtime environment and dependencies
- Failures in one container don't affect others
- Provides process isolation through Linux namespaces
---
**Portability**
- Runs consistently across different environments
- Works on any platform (development, testing, production)
- Eliminates "it works on my machine" problems
- Enables easy deployment across cloud providers
---
## Common Use Cases
- Development and Testing
- Microservices Architecture
- Resource Management
---
**Development and Testing**
- Standardized development environments
- Consistent testing environments
- Faster CI/CD workflows
- Parallel testing capabilities
---
**Microservices Architecture**
- Supports loosely coupled architectures
- Enables independent scaling of components
- Facilitates service isolation
- Simplifies updates and maintenance
---
**Resource Management**
- Dynamic scaling capabilities
- Efficient resource utilization
- Better hardware efficiency
- Cost-effective deployment options
---
## Docker Implementation
---
Docker is the most popular containerization platform, providing:
- A standardized container format
- Tools for building and managing containers
- A client-server architecture
- Image-based deployment model
---
The platform consists of:
1. Docker Engine (container runtime)
2. Docker CLI (command interface)
3. Docker Hub (container registry)
4. Docker Compose (multi-container orchestration)
